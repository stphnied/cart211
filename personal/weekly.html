                <p class="questions">
                    Imagine you go back in time to the 1970s to change the history of the internet to your
                    own
                    liking. Based on
                    the events described in the reading, how would you do it? How much funding would you need to achieve
                    the
                    changes you seek? Where do you get that funding from at the time, and how difficult is it to obtain?
                    What
                    does your answer to these questions say about the “great man theory” of history?
                </p>

                <p class="answers">
                    Honestly, I don't think I would be able to change the history of the internet even if I went
                    back in time
                    since the whole process seems a bit too complicated.

                    If I had to change something, I would prefer to have less involvement with the military and give
                    more power
                    to the netizens. If netizens were granted access to the Internet and make it open-source earlier,

                    I feel like they would've achieved a lot more than they did back then. However, it would be a lot
                    harder to
                    get fund from the government since the initial point was for the military.

                    The internet was not created by a single individual and discrediting anyone who added to the
                    evolution of
                    the Internet
                    would be like denying what it has become today. It is a product made from cumulative progress by
                    researchers
                    and others
                    that the Internet became what it is known for today. I believe it is a bit pretentious to say only a
                    few
                    individuals
                    created it, when in fact it is still something in progress. The great man theory shouldn’t not
                    glorify the
                    sole creator
                    but acknowledge the rest...

                <p class="questions">You live in the newly created country of North Turtle Island. All major online
                    services
                    such as social
                    networking, online shopping, film & television streaming, game platforms, etc are currently provided
                    through
                    the internet by tech companies based in the country to your South, where they keep all their
                    servers. These
                    companies do not provide jobs to any of your fellow citizens, take all the profits they make out of
                    your
                    country, and are so powerful and well-funded that none of the local startups of North Turtle Island
                    are
                    able
                    to compete.
                    You’ve been hired by the recently elected government to help create a thriving local tech economy
                    and
                    re-design the network infrastructure of your country, which used to be entirely owned by the
                    monopoly
                    conglomerate Omnicorp before the revolution and is now available to be put to the service of your
                    fellow
                    citizens however you propose it be. However, the ex-CEOs of Omnicorp who had taken refuge in the
                    South now
                    seem to be working with the tech companies there to promote fake news and conspiracy theories to
                    your
                    fellow
                    citizens on social media and to interfere with the democratic process.
                    What is your proposed course of action?

                    Seeing what happened when Canada wanted to create and provide its own Internet distribution and
                    failed
                    because
                    of the great influence and impact of the United States of America hold in the network providing
                    industry.
                    It is fair to say that it would be difficult to establish your own network when there is already a
                    well
                    known company nearby.
                    To have a better chance in succeeding,we will need to gain the trust and support from the citizens
                    of North
                    Turtle by offering better deals and providing them with help.
                    Assisting them with help freeof charge. We would also offer jobs for the citizens of North Turtle
                    and teach
                    them to grow the company bigger.
                    We would also publicize the company. We would also need to clarify any false rumor to erase all
                    doubt in
                    this company.

                <p class="questions">What do you think motivated early internet artists to make art on the internet?
                    What
                    defines success as an
                    artist, in your view? By that metric, which ones of the artists mentioned in the reading do you
                    think are
                    successful? What are some of your favorite pieces of internet art that we might not know about?</p>
                <p class="answers">
                    It was a new way of creating art. Since internet art was still a new technology, artists were eager
                    to
                    express themselves on a new blank canvas. There were no rules to follow, no right or wrong and they
                    were
                    free to explore different ways. I think being successful is very abstract. It depends on the artist
                    itself
                    if they are satisfied with their own work, I guess they can be called a successful artist. I believe
                    all
                    artists mentioned are worthy to be classified as ‘successful’. Some of my favorite pieces of
                    internet art
                    must be the recent new one called memes. It doesn’t necessarily have to be aesthetically pleasing
                    but they
                    are very enjoyable.

                    I couldn’t agree more with the first text written by Ted Nelson depicting that school systems
                    deprived children from their interest and robbed them from motivation and wanting to learn more.
                    They are forced to learn in a memorisation based way. I do believe that, generally speaking, we
                    learnt a lot more efficiently by applying what we learn instead of memorising it. What I mean by
                    that is, to lessen the amount of exams and replace them with exercises and innovative projects that
                    tackle the learnt materials. Giving them some requirements for the projects but also giving them the
                    freedom on how to do it is a way to motivate students. I would try to mostly switch all the tools
                    for multimedia and make everything accessible online. Sure there will still be lessons taught but I
                    will try to come up with fun project prompts/ideas for students to be able to express themselves.

                        and all its valuable output is licensed under the GNU General Public License.
                        You must find a way for Omnicorp to profit from future student research at Conkers U. You have a
                        $150 million CAD budget to achieve this goal, and will lose your job if shareholders do not see
                        a strong return on this investment. The administration of Conkers U. is eager to welcome your

                        division.
                        To bring more profit, I would make a free version and a pro version for those who wants

                        employees’ salaries. You notice that for the same job position and level of experience, women
                        employees are always paid less than men, on average 20% less. Women represent about 25% of the
                        entire company. Who do you talk to about this? What do you do about the situation? How do you

                        Gender pay inequality has been going on for a long time and we need to fight for equal pay. I
                        would also try to inform all the other employees about this fact because it is only fair for
                        them to know. Similar to the 2nd text The Dads of Tech by Astra Taylor and Joanne McNeil, when
                        they mentioned that women protested in their workplace for better pay and treatment. I would try
                        to come to an agreement with the higher ups, that all women employees should have equal pay to
                        the males and if not, I would go public with this matter to bring attention to this issue.
                        Depending on the bosses, two different reactions could come up : apologetic or furious. Either
                        way, it’s better to speak up now than let it slide.

                        <p class="questions">
                            You are a hacker with a day job as a software technician for a university research lab which
                            has been developing a new COVID-19 vaccine and is almost done with trials. You are one of
                            the few people with access to the private server network where the vaccine data is stored.
                            The research is funded by a company that sells face masks and hand sanitizer, and has seen
                            its value more than quadruple over the course of the epidemic. The company has also been
                            branching out and investing in online videoconferencing and enterprise software used by
                            bosses to spy on the computer of work-from-home employees. This company will own the patent
                            to the vaccine and fully control its distribution. All the scientists who performed the
                            research are worried and believe their vaccine should be freely available to everyone around
                            the world as soon as it is confirmed safe, but do not have the computer skills to make sure
                            this happens without getting caught.

                            Considering I am one of the only employees that has access to the private server for the
                            vaccine data, I do not think it would be a good idea for me to “hack” and share the research
                            data. I do believe that the vaccine should be free and accessible to all but that would also
                            cost me my job. Instead, I will try to find subtle ways to enter in contact with the
                            government and ask them to reach with the company and hoping they would come up with a deal
                            or agreement to publicize the research. It is very tempting to say that I would hack the
                            system and leak the content but I think I will be easily tracked down for it. One idea could
                            be to hack and lock all access to the private server and the condition would be to sign the
                            Open COVID Pledge, share the current research for the vaccine or reduce the cost/ not
                            overcharge people for it. Ideally, I would prefer if they chose to sign the Open COVID
                            Pledge to fight this global pandemic at the cost of profits.

                        <p class="questions"> One day, you get “noticed” for your great opinions and personality, and
                            your social media presence explodes overnight. You are now a minor e-celebrity: an
                            influencer with a significant platform. What does this change about your life? You receive
                            an offer from Pepsi to subtly promote their soft drinks on your social media content in
                            exchange for more money than you thought you’d ever see, which you are free to spend however
                            you like including donations to important causes, and Pepsi’s promotion will bring you an
                            even bigger online following and larger platform. How do you respond to this offer? Based on
                            the issues brought up in the readings, how do you justify your choice to your fans and to
                            your critics?</p>
                        <p class="answers">Being an influencer means I’ll have to be careful of what I say and post
                            because I can make an impact on people. I wouldn’t want to break the trust of my fanbase by
                            not being true to myself. I would try to deal with Pepsi and not to subtly promote but to
                            collaborate with Pepsi for a good cause. It will create advertisements and benefits for both
                            of us if we start a campaign to support a good cause. I would not keep all the money to
                            myself but donate the majority of it to those in need. I would also encourage Pepsi to start
                            a campaign where every time one of my followers use a specific code to purchase a drink, a %
                            of it goes to the campaign to fund a good cause. I wouldn’t try to do a product placement
                            with the sole purpose of profits.</p>

                    <p class="questions">What sort of problems exist in the world today that could be solved with the
                        help of network technology and new media? Why haven’t they been? What is the best way to decide
                        which software development and digital creative work is most important to do, and which one we
                        can probably do without? How could we ensure that the important work is funded, and where will
                        the funding come from? How can we get there, from where we are today?</p>
                    <p class="answers">There are actually a lot of issues going on where we could use network technology
                        to bring awareness to. It is hard to “solve” a problem but bringing attention and addressing it
                        is one way to take a step further in solving it. One of the main issues going around is
                        projecting a false image and circulating false information. A lot of companies, such as
                        Kickstarter, tend to claim that they are a progressive company yet their employees say
                        otherwise. They put on a facade to make consumers like us believe that they’re part of something
                        good when it is not entirely true. The best way to decide which software development and digital
                        creative work depends on what they are used for and how efficient they can be at work. It all
                        depends on the needs for them too.</p>
