                <p class="questions">
                    Imagine you go back in time to the 1970s to change the history of the internet to your
                    own
                    liking. Based on
                    the events described in the reading, how would you do it? How much funding would you need to achieve
                    the
                    changes you seek? Where do you get that funding from at the time, and how difficult is it to obtain?
                    What
                    does your answer to these questions say about the “great man theory” of history?
                </p>

                <p class="answers">
                    Honestly, I don't think I would be able to change the history of the internet even if I went
                    back in time
                    since the whole process seems a bit too complicated.

                    If I had to change something, I would prefer to have less involvement with the military and give
                    more power
                    to the netizens. If netizens were granted access to the Internet and make it open-source earlier,

                    I feel like they would've achieved a lot more than they did back then. However, it would be a lot
                    harder to
                    get fund from the government since the initial point was for the military.

                    The internet was not created by a single individual and discrediting anyone who added to the
                    evolution of
                    the Internet
                    would be like denying what it has become today. It is a product made from cumulative progress by
                    researchers
                    and others
                    that the Internet became what it is known for today. I believe it is a bit pretentious to say only a
                    few
                    individuals
                    created it, when in fact it is still something in progress. The great man theory shouldn’t not
                    glorify the
                    sole creator
                    but acknowledge the rest...

                <p class="questions">You live in the newly created country of North Turtle Island. All major online
                    services
                    such as social
                    networking, online shopping, film & television streaming, game platforms, etc are currently provided
                    through
                    the internet by tech companies based in the country to your South, where they keep all their
                    servers. These
                    companies do not provide jobs to any of your fellow citizens, take all the profits they make out of
                    your
                    country, and are so powerful and well-funded that none of the local startups of North Turtle Island
                    are
                    able
                    to compete.
                    You’ve been hired by the recently elected government to help create a thriving local tech economy
                    and
                    re-design the network infrastructure of your country, which used to be entirely owned by the
                    monopoly
                    conglomerate Omnicorp before the revolution and is now available to be put to the service of your
                    fellow
                    citizens however you propose it be. However, the ex-CEOs of Omnicorp who had taken refuge in the
                    South now
                    seem to be working with the tech companies there to promote fake news and conspiracy theories to
                    your
                    fellow
                    citizens on social media and to interfere with the democratic process.
                    What is your proposed course of action?

                    Seeing what happened when Canada wanted to create and provide its own Internet distribution and
                    failed
                    because
                    of the great influence and impact of the United States of America hold in the network providing
                    industry.
                    It is fair to say that it would be difficult to establish your own network when there is already a
                    well
                    known company nearby.
                    To have a better chance in succeeding,we will need to gain the trust and support from the citizens
                    of North
                    Turtle by offering better deals and providing them with help.
                    Assisting them with help freeof charge. We would also offer jobs for the citizens of North Turtle
                    and teach
                    them to grow the company bigger.
                    We would also publicize the company. We would also need to clarify any false rumor to erase all
                    doubt in
                    this company.

                <p class="questions">What do you think motivated early internet artists to make art on the internet?
                    What
                    defines success as an
                    artist, in your view? By that metric, which ones of the artists mentioned in the reading do you
                    think are
                    successful? What are some of your favorite pieces of internet art that we might not know about?</p>
                <p class="answers">
                    It was a new way of creating art. Since internet art was still a new technology, artists were eager
                    to
                    express themselves on a new blank canvas. There were no rules to follow, no right or wrong and they
                    were
                    free to explore different ways. I think being successful is very abstract. It depends on the artist
                    itself
                    if they are satisfied with their own work, I guess they can be called a successful artist. I believe
                    all
                    artists mentioned are worthy to be classified as ‘successful’. Some of my favorite pieces of
                    internet art
                    must be the recent new one called memes. It doesn’t necessarily have to be aesthetically pleasing
                    but they
                    are very enjoyable.
